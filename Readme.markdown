# Sandpiper

This is the compiler and interpreter of the Sandpiper Language. The project lives at [sandpiper-lang.org](http://www.sandpiper-lang.org).

## Whatâ€™s This Thing Here?

This project is, for the moment, a Sandpiper interpreter. In the near future it will grow into a compiler for static binaries.
